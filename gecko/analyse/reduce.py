'''
module to define the output

In its default, reduce functions take a list of values and reduce them into one.
For us (HEP) this is step usually corresponds to a histogram, a 1 to 3 D representation
of the data. Here, I would like to add also the functionality to save a subset of
the initial data in a separate file (tree or other format)
